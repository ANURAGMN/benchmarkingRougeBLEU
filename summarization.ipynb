      "(a) The department shall protect the state park system and the state vehicular recreation area and trail system from damage and preserve the peace therein.\n",
      "(b) The director may designate any officer or employee of the department as a peace officer. The primary duties of the peace officer shall be the enforcement of this division, Sections 4442 and 4442.5, the rules and regulations of the department, Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 650) of Division 3 of the Harbors and Navigation Code, the rules and regulations of the Division of Boating and Waterways within the department, Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 9850) of Division 3.5 of the Vehicle Code, and Division 16.5 (commencing with Section 38000) of the Vehicle Code and to arrest persons for the commission of public offenses within the property under its jurisdiction. The authority and powers of the peace officer shall be limited to those conferred by law upon peace officers listed in Section 830.2 of the Penal Code.\n",
      "(c) The department shall protect property included in the California recreational trail system and the property included in the recreational trail system under Section 6 of Chapter 1234 of the Statutes of 1980 from damage and preserve the peace therein. The primary duties of any officer or employee designated a peace officer under this section shall include enforcement of the rules and regulations established by the department and the arrest of persons for the commission of public offenses within the property included in the recreational trail system under Section 6 of Chapter 1234 of the Statutes of 1980.\n",
      "(d) Any person who violates the rules and regulations established by the department is guilty of either a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding 90 days, or by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment, or an infraction punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).\n",

      "Summary : (1) Existing law, when a person is arrested without a warrant, requires the person, if not otherwise released and without unnecessary delay, to be taken before the nearest or most accessible magistrate in the county in which the offense is triable, unless certain exemptions apply, including that the person was arrested for intoxication only and no further proceedings are desirable.\n",
      "This bill would exempt a person from the requirement of, without unnecessary delay, being taken before the nearest or most accessible magistrate in the county in which the offense is triable if the person is arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and the person is delivered to a hospital for medical treatment that prohibits immediate delivery before a magistrate.\n",
      "(2) Existing law requires the Department of Parks and Recreation to protect the state park system and the state vehicular recreation area and trail system from damage and to preserve the peace therein. Existing law provides that a person who violates the rules and regulations established by the department is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by imprisonment, as specified, except that at the time a particular action is commenced, the judge may, considering the recommendation of the prosecuting attorney, reduce the charged offense from a misdemeanor to an infraction. Existing law also requires that a person who is convicted of the offense after that reduction be punished by a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $1,000.\n",
      "This bill would instead make a person who violates those rules and regulations guilty of either a misdemeanor, punishable as provided under existing law, or an infraction, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000. The bill would delete the mandatory minimum fine.\n",
      "(3) Existing law, the Interstate Compact for Juveniles, adopted by this state and effective until January 1, 2016, establishes an interstate commission of the compacting states to, among other things, oversee, supervise, and coordinate the interstate movement of juveniles.\n",
      "This bill would delete the repeal date of these provisions, and would thereby extend the operation of the provisions indefinitely.\n",
      "(4) This bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Title : An act to amend Section 1031 of the Government Code, to amend Sections 384a, 849, and 4504 of, and to amend and renumber Section 4131.5 of, the Penal Code, to amend Section 5008 of the Public Resources Code, and to repeal Section 1403 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to public safety.\n"

When being cleaned in a manner or with a substance that is or may be harmful to a pet within the enclosure, that pet shall be removed from the enclosure.\\n(3) Be constructed of material suitable for regular cleaning and sanitizing.\\n(4) As needed to ensure the comfort and well-being of the pet, provide heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, shade, and protection from the elements, including, but not limited to, the sun, wind, rain, and snow.\\n(5) Allow a pet to turn around freely, stand easily, and sit or lie down in a comfortable position.\\n(b) Each enclosure is either a permanent or fixed enclosure or a temporary enclosure.\\n(c) In addition to the requirements set forth in subdivision (a), a permanent or fixed enclosure for a cat shall provide an elevated platform appropriate for the size of the cat.\\n(d) A pet may be contained in a temporary enclosure for a period not to exceed 4 hours during the day and 12 hours at night or the length of time that is humane for that particular pet, whichever is less. However, the pet shall remain outside the temporary enclosure for no less than the amount of time needed for the pet to eliminate its waste.\\n122383.\\nA pet boarding facility operator shall comply with all of the following animal care requirements:\\n(a) House only one pet at a time in an enclosure unless otherwise consented to by the owner.\\n(b) Observe each pet as necessary, but no less than once every 24 hours, in order to recognize the signs of sickness, injury, or distress, and in order to ensure that the pet, food, and waste or debris is removed as necessary to prevent contamination or injury.\\n(c) Provide each pet with easy and convenient access to potable water at all times, or if the behavior of the pet makes unrestricted access to water impracticable, offer water as often as necessary to ensure the pet’s health and well-being. However, water may be restricted as directed by the owner or a licensed veterinarian.\\n(d) Provide each pet with nutritious food in quantities and at intervals suitable for that pet.\\n(e) Provide each pet daily with enrichment sufficient to maintain the behavioral health of the pet.\\n(f) Maintain and abide by written policies and procedures that address animal care, management and safe handling, disease prevention and control, routine care, preventive care, emergency care, veterinary treatment, and disaster planning, evacuation, and recovery that are applicable to the location of the pet boarding facility. These procedures shall be reviewed with each employee who provides animal care and shall be present, in writing, either electronically or physically, in the facility and made available to all employees.\\n(g) Isolate those pets that have or are suspected of having a contagious condition.\\n(h) Ensure that each sick or injured pet is immediately provided with appropriate care and, if prudent, veterinary treatment.\\n(i) Ensure that the owner of a pet is notified immediately that his or her pet is sick or injured unless the owner has indicated in writing that notification of any, or a particular, type of illness or injury is not required.\\n(j) In the event of a natural disaster, an emergency evacuation, or other similar occurrence, ensure that the humane care and treatment of each animal is provided for, as required by this chapter, to the extent access to the pet is reasonably available.\\n122384.\\n(a) A pet boarding facility operator shall provide each owner with written information describing all of the following:\\n(1) Days and times during which the pet boarding facility permits pets to be dropped off and picked up.\\n(2) Days and times during which personnel are onsite.\\n(3) The square footage of the permanent or fixed and temporary enclosures in which the species of pet that the owner is boarding is customarily contained.\\n(4) General observation practices during each 24-hour period for the species of pet that the owner is boarding is customarily observed by personnel.\\n(5) The pet boarding facility’s customary daily activity schedule for the species of pet that the owner is boarding.\\n(b) If the pet boarding facility will materially deviate from the customary practices described in the written information required by subdivision (a) with respect to an owner’s pet, the pet boarding facility operator shall disclose those deviations to the owner or patron, as appropriate.\\n122385.\\nA pet boarding facility shall maintain either of the following:\\n(a) A fire alarm system that is connected to a central reporting station that alerts the local fire department in case of fire.\\n(b) A fire suppression sprinkler system.\\n122386.\\n(a) An animal control officer, as defined in Section 830.9 of the Penal Code, a humane officer qualified pursuant to Section 14502 or 14503 of the Corporations Code, or a peace officer who detects a violation of Sections 122380 to 122385, inclusive, if he or she decides the violation warrants formal action, shall issue a single notice to correct that shall contain all of the following information:\\n(1) Specify each violation of this chapter found in the inspection.\\n(2) Identify the corrective action for each violation.\\n(3) Include a specific period of time during which the listed violation or violations are to be corrected.\\n(b) After issuing a notice to correct pursuant to this section, the officer or another qualified officer of the issuing agency shall verify compliance with this chapter by conducting a subsequent investigation of the pet boarding facility within a reasonable period of time.\\n(c) An exact, legible copy of the notice to correct shall be delivered to the pet boarding facility operator at the time he or she signs the notice. In the alternative, the issuing agency may personally deliver the notice to the operator within 48 hours of its issuance, excluding holidays and weekends. The signing of the notice is an acknowledgment of receipt and does not constitute an admission of guilt.\\n(d) A pet boarding facility operator who is verified to have complied with a notice to correct shall not be subject to subdivision (g).\\n(e) A pet boarding facility operator who violates the same provision of this chapter on more than one occasion within a five-year period is not eligible to receive a notice to correct, and is guilty of an infraction on the second violation, and is guilty of a misdemeanor on the third or subsequent violation.\\n(f) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a pet boarding facility operator that causes or allows harm or injury to an animal, or allows an animal to be subject to an unreasonable risk of harm or injury is guilty of a misdemeanor.\\n(g) Except as provided in subdivisions (e) and (f), a pet boarding facility operator who violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250) for the first violation and by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each subsequent violation. The court shall weigh the gravity of the offense in setting the penalty.\\n122387.\\n(a) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to in any way limit or affect the application or enforcement of any other law that protects animals or the rights of consumers, including, but not limited to, Section 597 of the Penal Code.\\n(b) Nothing in this chapter limits, or authorizes any act or omission that violates, Section 597 of the Penal Code, or any other local, state, or federal law that protects animals or the rights of consumers.\\n122388.\\nPursuant to Section 7 of Article XI of the California Constitution, a city, county, or city and county may adopt ordinances that establish additional standards and requirements for a pet boarding facility.\\nSEC. 2.\\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\\u2009B of the California Constitution.',\n",
       " 'summary': 'Existing law regulates the care and maintenance of animals in the care of a pet store.\\nThis bill would establish procedures for the care and maintenance of pets boarded at a pet boarding facility, including, but not limited to, sanitation, provision of enrichment for the pet, health of the pet, and safety. The bill would specifically authorize a city, county, or city and county to adopt ordinances that establish additional standards and requirements for a pet boarding facility. The bill would require an animal control officer, a humane officer, or a peace officer who detects a violation of specified provisions by a pet boarding facility operator to issue a notice to correct and would provide that if the operator complies with the notice to correct he or she would not be subject to an infraction, except as provided. The bill would provide that an operator that causes or allows harm or injury to an animal or allows an animal to be subject to an unreasonable risk of harm or injury is guilty of a misdemeanor. The bill, except as provided, would make a violation of these provisions an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed $250 for the first violation and not to exceed $1,000 for each subsequent violation. Because it would create a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.',\n",
